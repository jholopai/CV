# cv_template

This is the first time I've used more than a few lines of HTML but learning how to make a CV with it was pretty fun.

## Todo
- I need to work on sectioning different classes more nicely so that the file is easier to manage and read afterwards.
- Fix current issue of side panel not showing up correctly in browser (when converting to a PDF everything looks fine)
- Overall needs to be cleaned up a bit
